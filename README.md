# DiscordTranslateBot
A Discord bot to translate between mostly No Man's Sky languages.
There are three languages provided, but if you format it the same you can basicly do every language you want.

Please keep the language files in the same folder as the program itself, the program will let you know if it does not find it.

the only thing you have to do is insert the bot token and run, its that simple.
