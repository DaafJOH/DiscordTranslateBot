# DiscordTranslateBot
A Discord bot to translate between mostly No Man's Sky languages.

First of all, you have to make sure that your path to file is correct.
There are three languages provided, but if you format it the same you can basicly do every language you want.

if it is not you'll get the following error code:
```File not found. Please double check path.```
if you get that well... you path is not correct...
